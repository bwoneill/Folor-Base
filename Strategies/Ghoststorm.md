## Ghoststorm Strategem

### Builds
* Fighter with Ion Torpedo
* Flex Ai farming/cap ship bomber
* Interceptor
* Interceptor
* Support with mask and beacons

### Opening: 
* Bomber farms AI
* Fighter and interecptors screen against enemies
* Support masks team and marks enemy team
### Defense: 
* Fighter immediately hits corvette with an ion torp and then join interceptors for defense
* Bomber farms AI
* Interceptors follow-up on beaconed enemies
* Bomber, fighter, and interceptors pivot between duties to hit corvette when alone
* Support monitors raider health overall morale, masks team, and marks ememy team
### Frigate Offense: 
* Support follows fighter on ion torp run (preferably following the corvette) and resupplies for second run
* Ai farmers switch to one with proton bombs and one fighter or interceptor
* Support follows proton bomber to unshielded frigate, applying beacons ahead or masking 1.5-2k away, refilling the bombers bombs after a run for immediate second attack
* Interceptor and eventually the fighter run interference, following up on called out threats or pressuring any enemy AI farmers
### Flagship Offense:
* Fighter will send ion torps to shields and do hit and runs if morale is high and/or corvette is healthy; stay in if about to flip. 
* Interceptor and fighter(s) cause ruckus on one side of flagship, away from the raider or incoming bomber, attack subsystems at will
* Support follows proton bomber towards shield gen, masking about 2-3k away and throws a supply droid on top of shield generator, then splits away
* If shields are disabled, prioritize morale over damage. Other wise is morale is high, get shields down, and if morale is low decide whether to blitz  or escape
* If flagship hp is ~35%, everyone focus power systems and straight hull damage
