* Bomber farms AI
* Interceptors follow-up on beaconed enemies
* Bomber, fighter, and interceptors pivot between duties to hit corvette when alone
* Support monitors raider health overall morale, masks team, and marks ememy team
### Frigate Offense: 
* Fighter makes first ion torp run (preferably the one targeted by the corvette/raider) and resupplies for second run
* Flex ai farm/anti-cap bomber begins run on first unshielded frigate
* Support follows bomber to unshielded frigate, applying beacons ahead and masking 1.5-2k away
* Fighter makes second ion torp run on remaining shielded frigate, then runs interference
* Interceptor and eventually the fighter run interference, pressuring first the ai farmer, then the support, and then following up on called out threats
### Flagship Offense:
* Interceptors and fighter cause ruckus on one side of flagship, away from the raider or incoming bomber, attack players at will, prioritizing the ai farmer and support
* Support follows bomber towards shield gen, masking about 1.5-2k away (or at first sign of engagement from enemy team) and marks the flagship
* Interceptors and fighter prioritize and engage any and all assailants on the bomber
* Bomber prioritizes next shield gen on same run, if possible
* Fighter flexes back to anti-cap to ion torpedo the Power subsystem
* If bomber is still alive, that pilot should immediately assist in destruction of the Power subsystem in the event that delivery of the ion torpedo fails
* All pilots focus on weak points and hull damage
### Flagship Defense:
