* Chua instructed the CCS squad on his attack strategy for both flagships.
  * VS MC75 – go for Shield Generators first with one-run bombers
  * VS ISD – Prioritize Power System and subsequent weak spots
* Gytheran demonstrated greater viability of disabling ISD shield gens for quick exposure of hull to damage. Variations of this are also being employed by notable players such as ScalpWakka, giving further credibility to this strategy.

## Next Practice:
* One or two scrims then into ranked battles
* Possible teams in draft night?
