# 12.28.20 practice summary

## Attendance

Psyren (left early), Gytheran, megazone, PowerPaladin, Black Ranger, bwoneill, maestro (tardy)

The team entered ranked, with one or more spectators rotating out. Held short conferences between matches, and later games were tougher than earlier ones.

Gytheran rose to leader’s challenge and showed off his stellar bomber capabilities. Such farm. So damaging. Wow.

Held a discussion regarding the setup and merits of advanced power management w/ maximize only controls and combo controls for shunting/shield balancing.

BlackRanger reached Hero III!

Psyren left early to attend Chillybutton’s beta bootcamp. Should be a one-time only schedule conflict. The team went up against significantly stronger opponents and was victorious. I’m very proud. Teamwork has improved drastically since the first match against tempest.

Next week we have a rematch at 9pm EST. Our challenging team consists of the following volunteers:

* Psyren
* Gytheran
* PowerPaladin
* BlackRanger
* Maestro
