## Accomplishments:
* Conducted the Follow the Leader Warmup
  * First time took a while to explain, but was met with enthusiasm
* Split up into ranked battles
  * Ghost consisted of Psyren, PopeOfToast, Megazone, mikep192
    * Continued Wraith’s anti-flagship strategies
    * Attempted fielding ion bombs against frigates
      * Bombing runs were partially successful. Often bomber would not be able to drop whole payload in one pass; the damage to shields fell between ion missile and ion torpedoes and was largely indefensible in comparison.
      * Got dusted by a high lvl 5-stack, but later games were mostly against baby seals. Easy victories even with some players dropping out early.
    * Phantom consisted of PowerPaladin, Gytheran, Bwoniell, Wolfen, and BlackRanger
      * Faced a team who ripped frigate shields before winning the toss-up. Phantom attempted to replicate this against another group with no success.
      * Kracken Reacharound appears to be 

## Next Practice:
* “chase” warmup
* Test use of ICT as an escort option for bombers
* Round table discussion and testing of bomber usage for objectives
  * Perhaps start training bombers to use fighters late game?
  * More vandersloop training. Let’s get under that shield early!
