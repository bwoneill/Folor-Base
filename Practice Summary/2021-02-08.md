* Wolfen, Pope, Megazone, Paladin, and Psyren entered fleet battles shortly after.
  * Attempted to shift roles. Paladin and Psyren took up PK, Megazone and PopeOfToast switched between bombing and dogfighting, and Wolfen switched between Support and bombing
  * Even against lower level teams, the group struggled to mesh into new roles. Even though there were less deaths, attacks on objectives were uncoordinated and ineffective.
  * Later after Pope and Wolfen left, Black Ranger arrived after a medical emergency.
  * Attempted to fly without any roles or overall plan, just working with whatever we felt like flying. This resulted in our first win for the night.
* Gytheran, Mikep192, Maestro, and Bwoniell moved to Phantom after the dogfighting. 
  * Had tough games, including a Gravy match
    * Chese was using his smurf account and took away extra points ☹
  * Hosted Tiberius for an impromptu whining about supports
    * Ended the night squishing some baby seals

## Next Practice:
* Try looser fleet battle organization. Developing and understanding individual skills of teammates leads to better results and more reasonable plans. 
* The goal is for everyone to be able to hop into games with any teammate and already have some synergy, regardless of roles or number of players.
  * How to divide teams for practice
    * Lottery?
    * Schedule proximity?
    * Preference to tournament teams?
