* Gytheran

* maestro
* BlackRanger (left early)
* megazone (tardy)

Employed the Ghostorm Strategy in ranked matches to great success. Singular Roles were fine tuned over a long win streak, ended by a random gravy game with Tempest in the Zavian Abyss.

Offense against Tempest was good, defense was lacking. The loss can largely be attributed to the abysmal map and a shuffling of roles after Black Ranger left. 

Focus on mastering the Ghostorm Strat in one role before switching to others. Priorities are:

Understanding the Strat

Developing strength in one role

Developing strength in multiple roles

Gytheran achieved Valiant!

Considerations for our star lineup are coming together. Will be discussed more after holidays are over.
