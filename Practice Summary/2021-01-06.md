## Accomplishments:
* Lesson on Radar use, including its zones, icons, and range finding. Team members encouraged to turn off the off-screen indicator and rely on instruments and visual scanning.
* Explained and tested the Cheese Opening:
  * Bomber(s) AI farm
  * Fighter and Support strip Shields on corvette and apply beacons
  * Bomber(s) use the beam cannon on corvette, then return to AI farming while it recharges
  * Interceptors cover Bombers
  * Support carries resupply to refill fighter for next phase and patch up allies
* Chua explained a strategy I’m calling the “Pika-chua”, where a single specialized fighter can wipe out the power system. The Fighter build is:
  * Ion Cannon (for Power)
  * Ion Torpedo (for Shields)
  * Ion Missile (for Power)
  * Reflec Hull
  * Overloaded Shields (on X-wing only)
  * Standard Engines
* We split up into two group for ranked, practicing both strategies and better understanding roles. 
  * Ghost group had middling success; executing the Pika-chua was easy but following up offense against strong dogfighting teams was challenging. Cheese opening was tougher. It should improve as timing and weapon proficiency rises. 
* Chua also demonstrated his approaches for attacking MC75 shield generator to Ghost group

## Next Practice:
* Flagship attack practice
  * Pika-chua runs for fighters
  * Shield Runs for bombers
* Maybe more ranked matches
* Otherwise open agenda
