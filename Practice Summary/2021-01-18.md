## Accomplishments:
* Debriefed our team on the Cal Cup Winter Minor, who placed 24th of 64
  * Lots of teams were fighter/interceptor heavy
  * Morale was difficult to maintain, due to high player death and opposing AI farm
  * Both factors lead to a few losses to attrition as opposed to overwhelming offense
    * Focus in future practices should evolve from objective play to anti-player play to cover these weaknesses
  * Scoreboards from matches was archived in Folor Base
* Mikep192 shared a new resource for sharing ship loadouts: https://squadrons.starwarsbuilds.com/
* Held an impromptu mini class on deaddrifting – 30 min
  * Boost until up to speed > Divert all energy from engines > Engage Drift
  * All attending pilots demonstrated successful dead drifts across the surface of Esseless
  * Usefulness for evasion will likely be patched out, but its unique utility in positioning will be valuable
* One scrimmages match, debrief was cut short due to pilots leaving early
  * Ion missiles can be used to drop corvette shields, saving Ion torpedoes for other targets
* Discussed planning for future practices, noting desire for both more matches and specific skill workshops
  * Psyren offered to relay partial lessons from ChillyButton’s Flight School
  * Workshops on interceptor play was requested
  * Such workshops demand quite a bit of time, and switching focus may be detrimental, so I’d like to dedicate certain days for either lessons or pure Fleet Battle gameplay.

## Next Practice:
* 2 scrims warmup then into ranked battles
* Confirm workshop topics for Monday, January 25th
