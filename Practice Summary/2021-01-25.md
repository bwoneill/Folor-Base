## Accomplishments:
* Engaged in a “chase” simulation, a possible template for warm-ups
  * One player follows a partner, attempting to keep them in sight and within 500m (aka the killslot). The leader attempts to evade, but does not try to get into an attack position.
  * After five minutes the partners switch roles, performing the exercise for another 5 minutes. 10 minutes is a round.
  * The first round is safeties-on: no boost or weaponry. The second round is live fire: the follower tries any method to destroy your target
* Introduced the use of dead drifting for dogfights with a “fishhook” maneuver
  * Allows a pilot quickly to maneuver behind a fresh target into a kill slot position
    * Fly directly towards a foe. When the distance is closed, quickly aim off center and execute a dead drift.
    * Time the dead drift so that you are starting to track the enemy in your sights as you pass them, possibly landing a few early hits. Once behind the enemy, cancel your momentum with a short boost to return to speed.
    * The goal is to:
      1. feint with a direct divebomb approach;
      2. abruptly change speed and direction once in range and;
      3. already be on target and in optimal attack range while the enemy only just begins to track you
    * We practiced this in a simulated joust situation with both stock fighters and interceptors. Distances/ time marks will change depending on ship’s speeds, maneuverability, angle of approach, and the target’s initial response. 
      * Successful execution in our practice allows the pilot to avoid most of the initial joust damage and reacquire line of sight faster than an opponent of the same build.
    * The move is untested in real battle. On first impression, it is at least good for:
      * Training quick power management while in combat
      * Practicing taking enemy specs into consideration before/during engagements (turn rate, speed, ttk, etc.)
      * Quickly repositioning behind oblivious bombers for a kill

* Last portion of practice was used for science, testing damage fall off on weapons and the quirks of the Y-wing Ion Cannon Turret (ICT)
  * Burst Cannons appear to have no damage fall off at all, dealing full damage even at max range. The sniper weapon of the game.
  * Standard lasers appear to drop off up until ~500m, after which any damage loss is much lower
  * Rotary cannons appear to have a constant rate of damage fall off through its entire range
  * The ICT’s targeting preferences remain a mystery. Strangely enough, it doesn’t appear to target motionless enemies, even at point blank range. The “T” in ICT must stand for Tyrannosaurus.

## Next Practice
* “chase” warmup
* Scrimmage to reinforce current strategy
* Organize into groups and enter ranked fleet battles
* Discuss workshop topics for Monday, February 1st, 2021
