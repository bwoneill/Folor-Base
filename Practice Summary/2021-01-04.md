## Next Practice:
* Lesson on Radar use and why the offscreen arrow is the devil
* Dissection of Team Cheese opening tactic
* Trying out the alternate offensive strategy Chua has brought to us. Its very different from our current one:
  * Frigates
    * Fighter Ion torpedos both frigates 
    * Support runs targeting beacon/resupply
    * Bomber  runs proton bombs
    * Support must use targeting beacon on frigates and resupply proton bombs for maximum damage, other teammates run interference
    * Repeat until burned.
  * Capital Ship
    * Fighter Blows Power
    * Fighter/Interceptor takes out weak points and enemy targets of interest [support/ AI farmer bomber] 
    * Support uses targeting beacons to increase weak point damage (important)
    * Ignore shield gens
    * Ship health should be around 50-20%
    * Bombers to blow hull plates, should be about 5% per hull plate
